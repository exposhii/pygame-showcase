<h1> IMPORTANT THINGS </h1>
Forgive me for not having an actual executable file for this, but I currently do not have the time to deal with errors regarding pyinstaller. That being said, I have provided the source code of the game (main.py) as well as a folder of all the assets used, so you can try to build the project on your own with your own text editor/IDE. There is also a video of me showcasing the game itself here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q-LLpQ_VPrkUFIcsR9E5KiBLhJCuSYiM/view?usp=sharing), note that it's in Indonesian however.
